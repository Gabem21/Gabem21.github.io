## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 7

  This lab was my favorite because I was in a team of three people and was able to collaborate with more people for this specific lab. This was my favorite also because of the content of the lab itself as it was centered around parking signs and our job was to read the signs and code commands based on the times parking was allowed. It was very fun and almost like a game having these different signs and figuring out how to write different commands based on the regulations. 

* Lab 6

  This lab was my second favorite because the lab was focused around gathering scores for the card game blackjack and I particularly enjoy playing cards, specifically this card game. This lab was also my second favorite because my partner was very easy to work with and we had fun while going through this lab

* Lab 11

  This lab was my third favorite because I once again got to collaborate with multiple people, both of which were great partners and very helpful when we were going through the lab. This lab was one of my favorites also because it allowed me to work with while loops very often which was very interesting. Having to take the values from the state population data table provided for us in the lab and having to figure out which commands to use was also very fun as it was like math to me, and i really enjoy math.
